=head1 NAME

App::runscript - Module that implements the runscript utility

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  runscript <perl application> <arguments pass to the perl application>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module assumes that you have deployed a perl application (application)
locally using the L<local::lib/Other-bootstrapping-options> procedure.  Usually
you are able to execute the application only because the PERL5LIB environment
variable was amended. This amendment is needed so that the application is able
to locate the libraries it depends on. If the application does not find its
dependencies it will fail with the message

  Can't locate ... in @INC (@INC contains: ...

The C<runscript> utility helps you to avoid the PERL5LIB amendment.

=over

=item -

It finds out the absolute path of a given perl application. If the application
is in the PATH you may pass its basename to runscript.

=item -

It takes the dirname of the absolute path and removes the I<bin> subdirectory.
The result is the "install base".

=item -

It adds the directory I<lib/perl5> to the "install base".

=item -

It prepends the final library path to C<@INC> before executing the
application.
