NAME

App::runscript - Implements the runscript utility

DESCRIPTION

This configurator class is able to process Log4perl YAML configurations.

INSTALLATION

To install this module manually, run the following commands:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

DOCUMENTATION

After the installation, you can find further documentation using the commands:

  perldoc App::runscript

MAINTENANCE

To maintain this module, run the following commands:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make PERL_CPANM_OPT="--notest --with-configure --with-develop --with-recommends" installdeps
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make RELEASE_TESTING=1 test  # use Test::Harness
  make RELEASE_TESTING=1 testp # use TAP::Harness
  make cover                   # coverage statistics in vim format

The second command installs the module dependencies in a "local" directory
using "cpanm". The experimental "--with-configure" option is usually needed
because setting the VERSION often fails due to a not up to date "version"
module.  A reconfiguration (second "perl Makefile.PL" call) should not raise
warnings anymore.
